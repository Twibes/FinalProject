## Why the world needs Twibes

**The year 2020 has not been the best year for most of our community.** Whether we consider the Black Lives Matter protests which took place as a response to the killing of George Floyd and several other incidents, the Delhi Riots which took place due to protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in India, the COVID-19 pandemic which affected folks across the world or any other major issue, the year has definitely taken a toll on all of our health.

While a lot of us can cope with taking care of our physical health, most people are not well equipped to manage their mental health. A major reason for this is that there is a lot of stigma revolving around discussions of mental health in most parts of the world. That combined with the lack of education on mental health, **most people are either unaware of or reject the existence of mental health issues**.

Ever since the pandemic began, we have been restricted to the confines of our homes, limiting our interactions with our peers and acquaintances in the outside world. This has made it difficult for most people to find "safe spaces" where they can be themselves without any external worry. Due to this, one of the most convenient platforms for people to express is social media. **Social media is a great platform to quickly spread awareness** about different matters, **however it can promote as well as reinforce certain ideas or perspectives in peoples' minds, some of which may be highly detrimental**.

In this huge crisis around mental health, **we want to give people a chance to take their first steps in comfortable tracking the status of their mental health and heal it using** one of our favourite means, **music**. Music therapy is an evidence-based clinical use of musical interventions to improve peoples' quality of life that has existed for thousands of years. With this solution, **we look forward to enabling people all around the world to develop a habit of tracking their own mental health and care better for themselves**.
